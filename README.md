# Devops Code Challenge

The goal of this cod challenge is to provide a broad range of coverage across various skill sets.  The inability to complete this exercise independently does not constitute a failure.  It's merely designed to demostrate subject matter expertise and expose knowledge gaps.  This is a 'take home' challenge that should be completed prior to your technical interview.  You will be expected to review & execute your code during the technical interview.
